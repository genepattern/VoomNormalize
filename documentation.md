## Introduction

This module is used to preprocess RNA-Seq data into a form suitable for use downstream in other GenePattern analyses such as GSEA, ComparativeMarkerSelection, NMFConsensus, as well as GENE-E and other visualizers.  Many of these tools were originally designed to handle microarray data - particularly from Affymetrix arrays - and so we must be mindful of that origin when preprocessing data for use with them.

The module does this by using a mean-variance modeling technique [1] to transform the dataset to fit an approximation of a normal distribution, with the goal of thus being able to apply classic normal-based microarray-oriented statistical methods and workflows.

## Algorithm

This modeling technique is called 'voom' and is part of the 'limma' package of Bioconductor [1] [2].  Use of this method requires the user to supply raw read counts as produced by HTSeq or RSEM.  These counts should not be normalized and also should not be RPKM or FPKM values.  The MergeHTSeqCounts module in GenePattern is capable of producing a suitable GCT from HTSeq output.

The module first performs a filtering pass on the dataset to remove any features (rows) without at least 1 read per million in _n_ of the samples, where _n_ is the size of the smallest group of replicates (recommended in [3]).  Note that this not a simple threshold on the count but rather a filtering using CPM (counts per million) values calculated just for this purpose.  The raw values are still used for variance modeling; these CPM values are only used for filtering and then subsequently discarded.  The module will automatically determine the smallest group of samples (_n_) based on their classifications in the user-supplied CLS file.

* The threshold level can be adjusted using the _expression.value.filter.threshold_  advanced parameter, though the default value follows the recommendations from [1] and [3] and should suffice for most users.

Next, the module performs normalization of the dataset using Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) [4] on the raw counts of any remaining features that pass the filter.  Finally, the module performs the mean-variance transformation to approximate a normal distribution using the 'voom' method of the 'limma' package, returning a new dataset with values in logCPM (log2 counts per million) that can be used with classic normal-based microarray-oriented statistical methods and workflows.

1. <input.file>  
A GCT file containing raw read counts for your RNA-Seq data.  
2. <cls.file>

## Output Files

1. <output.file>  (by default, <input.file_basename>.preprocessed.gct  
A GCT file containing the preprocessed dataset.  Note that this may have fewer rows than the original GCT due to the filter.
